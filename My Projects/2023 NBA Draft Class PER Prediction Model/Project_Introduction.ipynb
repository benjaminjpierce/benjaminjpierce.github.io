    "# Motivation:\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "A problem that data science can provide helpful insights for is predicting the success of players in the NBA draft. By analyzing performance data from college players, classification algorithms can identify players with the potential to become stars based on their statistics.\n",
    "This is an important problem for NBA teams as they invest a lot of money in drafting players, and their success depends on picking the right players. According to a study by DraftExpress, over the last 20 years, NBA teams have spent over $1 billion on draft picks, and the success rate of those picks has been only around 50% (1). Therefore, using data science to improve the accuracy of draft predictions could lead to significant benefits for NBA teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schlosser, K. (2019). An NBA team's draft mistake can cost them $8.3 million, and the league is using AI to help make better decisions. Business Insider.\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "The goal of this project is to utilize statistical features of basketball players such as points per game, field goal percentage, and player efficiency rating to predict their efficacy in the NBA draft. By analyzing the relationships between these statistical features and a player's performance in the draft, we can identify key factors that contribute to success in the NBA. To create a prediction model we will train our model on all of the draft classes sucess in the NBA from 2009-2018. This will require cleaning the data and mergering their NBA PER with their college statisitics. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact\n",
    "If successful, this work on predicting the potential success of NBA draft picks based on their performance data may have several impacts. Firstly, it could help NBA teams to make more informed decisions when selecting players in the draft. This could lead to more successful draft classes, which may translate into more successful seasons for the teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there could be some negative impacts as well. For example, relying too heavily on machine learning algorithms to make player selections could lead to a lack of diversity in the types of players chosen. This could stifle innovation and creativity in the sport, as teams focus solely on picking players who fit the mold of what the algorithm identifies as successful."

    "# Dataset\n",
    "## Detail\n",

    "We will use a [2009-2018 NBA Draft College Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityak2003/college-basketball-players-20092021/code?select=CollegeBasketballPlayers2009-2021.csv) as our training data. We will drop missing values and merge college and current NBA PER. We will use df.groupby(“Player”).mean() for repeated player names for players who switch teams in the middle of a season\n",

    "\n",
    "## Sufficient Data\n",
    "\n",
    "These statistics can provide us with insights into a player's strengths and weaknesses, allowing us to assess their potential success in the NBA. For example, a player who has a high PPG and a high FG% may be more likely to become a successful scorer in the NBA. Similarly, a player who has a high RPG and a high BPG may be more likely to become a successful rebounder and shot blocker. By analyzing these statistics and identifying patterns and trends, we can create models and algorithms that can predict a player's potential success in the NBA draft. Additionally, I have included advanced stats from the dataset including PER, TS% etc. that can help us make complex descisions. Additionally, our college dataset has many data points to help us create a more accurate predictor. "

    "To predict an NBA player's Player Efficiency Rating (PER) based on their college statistics, we employed a regression machine learning model. By using regression, we were able to identify and quantify the relationships between NBA PER and college statistics, and then use these relationships to predict PER values based on the independent variables of college stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to improve our model’s accuracy, we also utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By applying PCA, we can improve the overall performance and accuracy of our model. \n",

    "Our final regression model was a RandomForestRegressor that utilizes both PCA and cross validation to predict NBA PER using 10 years of data. This give us an indication of how good our model was a prediciting the 2023 draft class's PER. "
